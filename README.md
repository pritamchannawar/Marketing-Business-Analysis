# Marketing Business Analysis

The Project emphasizes the critical role of marketing in a business's growth and sustainability. It outlines four key areas where marketers contribute:

Education: Marketers educate customers about the company's value proposition. Engagement: They engage with customers to understand their needs. Driving Sales: Marketers are instrumental in driving sales and directing traffic to products or services. Growth: They help businesses grow by reaching new customers. The Project also addresses a significant challenge for marketers: understanding their customers and identifying their needs. It suggests that when customer data is available, data science can be applied for effective market segmentation. This involves launching targeted marketing campaigns tailored to specific customer groups.

The Project includes a case study where a consultant is hired by a New York City bank with extensive customer data from the past six months. The bank's marketing team aims to launch a targeted ad campaign by dividing their customers into at least three distinct groups.

Additionally, the Project briefly touches on the concept of k-means clustering, an unsupervised learning algorithm used in data science for grouping data points. This method is likely related to the market segmentation strategy mentioned in the case study.
